# Contribution and Future Plans :
Our experimentation was an approach towards building a deep
neural network architecture which uses both temporal and spatial information. Our model showed significant performance
in solving this multi-label genre classification problem. We
were able to successfully combine pre-trained model with our
existing architecture to get more accurate result.  In future, we
wish to work further to fine-tune the model and achieve state
of the art accuracy.
