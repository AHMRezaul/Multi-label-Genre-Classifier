After graduation, she aspires to work in the agency\\'s Behavioral Science Unit under the leadership of Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn). While she is still a trainee, Crawford asks her to question Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Sir Anthony Hopkins), a psychiatrist imprisoned, thus far, for eight years in maximum security isolation for being a serial killer who cannibalized his victims. Clarice is able to figure out the assignment is to pick Lecter\\'s brains to help them solve another serial murder case, that of someone coined by the media as \"Buffalo Bill\" (Ted Levine), who has so far killed five victims, all located in the eastern U.S., all young women, who are slightly overweight (especially around the hips), all who were drowned in natural bodies of water, and all who were stripped of large swaths of skin.

After speaking to Lecter for the first time, she realizes that everything with him will be a psychological game, with her often having to read between the very cryptic lines he provides.

A potential seventh victim is high profile Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith), the daughter of Senator Ruth Martin (Diane Baker), which places greater scrutiny on the case as they search for a hopefully still alive Catherine. Who may factor into what happens is Dr. Frederick Chilton (Anthony Heald), the warden at the prison, an opportunist who sees the higher profile with Catherine, meaning a higher profile for himself if he can insert himself successfully into the proceedings.',\n"," \"Over 10 years have passed since the first machine called The Terminator tried to kill Sarah Connor and her unborn son, John.

From wearing braces on his legs, to having a below average IQ and even being shot, Gump continues to believe that good things will happen and goes after his dreams. While several less than ideal things occur during Gump's life, he manages to turn each setback into something good for him, such as when he finally gets his braces off he discovers that he is capable of running faster than most other people. This skill allows Gump to not only escape his bullies while he is a child in Greenbow, but also to gain a football scholarship, save many soldiers' lives and become famous for his ability.

Michael Burry, an eccentric ex-physician turned one-eyed Scion Capital hedge fund manager, has traded traditional office attire for shorts, bare feet and a Supercuts haircut. He believes that the US housing market is built on a bubble that will burst within the next few years. Autonomy within the company allows Burry to do largely as he pleases, so Burry proceeds to bet against the housing market with the banks, who are more than happy to accept his proposal for something that has never happened in American history. The banks believe that Burry is a crackpot and therefore are confident in that they will win the deal. Jared Vennett with Deutschebank gets wind of what Burry is doing and, as an investor believes he too can cash in on Burry\\'s beliefs.

Baum and his associates, who work at an arms length under Morgan Stanley, decide to join forces with Vennett despite not totally trusting him. In addition to Burry\\'s information, they further believe that most of the mortgages are overrated by the bond agencies, with the banks collating all the sub-prime mortgages under AAA packages.

Although initially programmed solely to target mutants, the Sentinels soon began eradicating humans who possessed the DNA to breed mutants, and eventually, any mortal mutant sympathizers. Desperate, Professor Xavier (Sir Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen) devise a plan to have Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) send Wolverine back to the year when Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) assassinated Trask.

They can spend months or years on a single story, which they choose amongst themselves. As such, they are somewhat autonomous from the rest of the newspaper, only needing to report to their superior. As a rule, they are not to discuss their work with anyone else, whether it be other staff, friends and or family. In 2001, the four person team consisted of its editor Walter Robinson - Robby to his friends - and his team of three investigative journalists, Michael Rezendes, Sacha Pfeiffer and Matt Carroll. Robby reports to the assistant managing editor, Ben Bradlee Jr.. Upon his arrival from his most recent position in Florida, Marty Baron, the newly appointed editor-in-chief. Mr. Baron requests Spotlight to place their current project on hold and dig deeper into a recent story written by fellow Globe reporter and columnist Eileen McNamara, regarding allegations against a Catholic priest of sexual abuse of a minor and what appears to be the subsequent cover-up by the head of the Archdiocese of Boston, Cardinal Bernard Law. They are at first hesitant to work on the story, seeing Baron as an outsider to Boston, he who doesn't understand what is important to locals. Baron's outsider status includes not being born and raised there, and not being Catholic (he being the Globe's first Jewish editor-in-chief). Spotlights first task is to see if they can get some court documents on the case unsealed, which means they will need a court order. The Church and its parishioners could falsely interpret this as The Globe suing the Catholic church. This could have major, negative consequences for The Globe due to the fact that a majority of their subscribers are Catholic. Robby and his team begin by speaking to lawyers who have or are working on alleged sexual abuse cases perpetrated by Catholic priests in and immediately surrounding Boston (those lawyers said including Eric MacLeish and Mitchell Garabedian), known victims (such as Phil Saviano, the head of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP)) and insiders in the Catholic church. Through this investigation, they get wind that the problem is not contained to a couple of priests and few victims, in essence changing the focus from the priest(s) to the systemic problem of the Archdiocese not only covering up the abuse but in reality doing nothing to stop it and thus condoning it. Their goal is not only the end product of an important story, but making sure that the other major local newspapers, such as the Boston Herald, do not beat them to the scant outline of the story in the public consciousness which the Catholic church could easily quash. Through it all, they may come to some unpleasant realizations that not only the Archdiocese and the Catholic church in general are to blame for what happened.\",\n"," 'Steins; Gate is a story about time travel and the consequences of it\\'s misuse.

They are raised in different environments of Metro City but study in the same school for gifted children. While one becomes popular but selfish, the other is absolutely outcast by the other students. They become enemies and when they grow up, the population knows them as the superhero Metro Man and the villain Megamind. In their fights, Megamind always loses and ends up in prison; however, Megamind develops a ray that kills Metro Man, reducing him to a skeleton. After a short period, Megamind feels bored without the battles against Metro Man. Meanwhile he dates field reporter Roxanne Ritchie, who works with cameraman Hal Stewart, using the identity of curator Bernard and sooner they fall in love with each other. When Megamind decides to create another superhero to become his opponent, he accidentally transforms Hal Stewart into the super-powered Tighten, expecting that he would use his powers for good.

One child, a handsome boy endowed with superpowers, landed in a mansion and was admired by all; he became the superhero Metro Man. The other, a blue-skinned baby with super genius, ended up in a prison and was shunned by society; he became the supervillain Megamind, Metro Man&#39;s rival.<br/><br/>All is as usual in Metro City: the town felicitates Metro Man with the inauguration of his own museum, when Megamind gatecrashes the event and announces that he has (once again) escaped from prison with the help of his childhood friend/henchman Minion. Following routine, he has once again kidnapped Metro Man&#39;s girlfriend, reporter Roxanne Ritchi. Megamind lures Metro Man into a sealed observatory which will be blown up by a laser, but the laser takes too long to start up, so once more Megamind has failed and Metro Man is victorious... but Metro Man can&#39;t escape the observatory. He states that the observatory is lined with copper, which drains his powers. Unable to escape when the laser activates, Metro Man is incinerated into a skeleton. Megamind has fulfilled the supervillain&#39;s dream, to the shock of everyone (including Megamind himself): he has vanquished the superhero, and Metro City is now his to take over!<br/><br/>Megamind revels in his victory, and sets about vandalizing and pillaging Metro City. However,as time passes he becomes depressed and empty. He realizes that a supervillain has no point without a superhero to fight: without Metro Man, his life has lost all fun, challenge and purpose. He pays a visit to the Metro Man museum to express his condolences, and there meets Roxanne, who has come for the same reason. He disguises himself as the museum curator Bernard, and the two establish a friendship with each other. Roxanne is optimistic that a hero will soon rise to oppose Megamind&#39;s villainy, and this gives Megamind an idea: if heroes were &#39;not born but created&#39;, he will create a hero to fight, and thus restore balance to Metro City and purpose to his life!<br/><br/>Megamind uses Metro Man&#39;s DNA to forge a special serum that provides superpowers. However at the moment of near completion, Roxanne sneaks into Megamind&#39;s lair to find out what his future evil plans are. In the resulting melee the serum is accidentally ingested by Roxanne&#39;s friend Hal Stewart, a smug and lazy cameraman who has an obsessive crush on Roxanne and who&#39;s been overlooked and ignored his whole life. Despite these qualities, Megamind feels Hal was chosen by destiny for heroics. Megamind, disguised as a Space Dad, trains Hal into Titan, Metro City&#39;s upcoming new hero. Titan appears to Roxanne and carries out superhuman feats to impress her, but she rejects him because she likes Bernard.<br/><br/>In the meantime, Megamind carries on a romance with Roxanne through his Bernard alias, which starts to give him hope about a normal life, beyond villainy. This unfortunately creates conflict with Minion, who believes that as villains they&#39;ll never find romance or acceptance. A quarrel ensues between the duo, which ends with Minion leaving because he thinks Megamind doesn&#39;t need him anymore. Later, at a romantic dinner, Roxanne discovers Megamind&#39;s disguise and rejects him.<br/><br/>Heartbroken and friendless, Megamind does what supervillains do: start a rampage across town and a battle with a superhero. But Titan does not show up, and eventually Megamind has to head over to Hal&#39;s apartment to pick him up. There he discovers Titan has had enough of rejection, and has decided to strike back and become a supervillain, offering a team up with Megamind. A shocked Megamind reveals his Space Dad and Bernard identities to Titan and successfully provokes a superhuman fight. But upon defeating Megamind, an enraged Titan tries to murder him; Megamind barely escapes, and Titan proclaims himself Metro City&#39;s new supervillain and starts tearing up the town.<br/><br/>Noting that a copper-based attack proved ineffective on Titan, Megamind convinces a reluctant Roxanne to head to Metro Man&#39;s lair to check for anything that could help stop Titan. They both check out the base, and discover to their shock that Metro Man is staying there, alive! He explains to them that he&#39;d always wanted to be a musician, but just like Megamind he got typecast and trapped as a superhero, and eventually the role became too unbearable; he thus faked his weakness to copper and subsequent death, to forever rid himself of heroism. He refuses to return, and nominates Megamind as his successor and Roxanne backs him up, but Megamind refuses as he believes he is condemned to be a villain for life.<br/><br/>Megamind turns himself into the prison he was raised, while Roxanne heads into Metro City to try to reason with Titan. Titan, gone over the edge, instead captures Roxanne and makes a TV broadcast to call out Megamind, exhibiting her to make sure he comes. Roxanne begs Megamind to save her and Metro City from Titan, and Minion returns to stand by Megamind&#39;s side; this finally inspires him to escape from prison. A fierce battle follows across Metro City, where Megamind eventually defeats Titan by stripping him of his powers, turning him back into Hal.<br/><br/>The film ends with Hal in Megamind&#39;s prison cell, and Megamind being accepted and hailed by Metro City as its new hero, with Roxanne as his girlfriend, felicitating his own museum and approval from a disguised Metro Man.</li>\\n    </ul>\\n

Their fate on Earth is opposite: one who is a beautiful baby with superpowers crashes in the lawn of a mansion, while the other who is ugly and blue with a big head crashes in a prison yard with his companion Minion. They are raised in different environments of Metro City but study in the same school for gifted children. While one becomes popular but selfish, the other is absolutely outcast by the other students. They become enemies and when they grow up, the population knows them as the superhero Metro Man and the villain Megamind. In their fights, Megamind always loses and ends up in prison; however, Megamind develops a ray that kills Metro Man, reducing him to a skeleton. After a short period, Megamind feels bored without the battles against Metro Man. Meanwhile he dates field reporter Roxanne Ritchie, who works with cameraman Hal Stewart, using the identity of curator Bernard and sooner they fall in love with each other. When Megamind decides to create another superhero to become his opponent, he accidentally transforms Hal Stewart into the super-powered Tighten, expecting that he would use his powers for good. However, Tighten becomes greedy and evil and destroys Metro City. Now Megamind is the only hope to save the world from the mean Tighten.</p>\n","<div class=\"author-container\">\n","<em>—<a href=\"/search/title?plot_author=Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil&amp;view=simple&amp;sort=alpha&amp;ref_=ttpl_pl_2\">Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</a></em>\n","</div>\n","</li>\n","<li class=\"ipl-zebra-list__item\" id=\"summary-ps3167688\">\n","<p>When the blue-headed super villain Megamind finally defeats his arch-enemy, Metro Man, he has no hero to fight and loses his purpose.

One child, a handsome boy endowed with superpowers, landed in a mansion and was admired by all; he became the superhero Metro Man. The other, a blue-skinned baby with super genius, ended up in a prison and was shunned by society; he became the supervillain Megamind, Metro Man's rival.<br/><br/>All is as usual in Metro City: the town felicitates Metro Man with the inauguration of his own museum, when Megamind gatecrashes the event and announces that he has (once again) escaped from prison with the help of his childhood friend/henchman Minion. Following routine, he has once again kidnapped Metro Man's girlfriend, reporter Roxanne Ritchi. Megamind lures Metro Man into a sealed observatory which will be blown up by a laser, but the laser takes too long to start up, so once more Megamind has failed and Metro Man is victorious... but Metro Man can't escape the observatory. He states that the observatory is lined with copper, which drains his powers. Unable to escape when the laser activates, Metro Man is incinerated into a skeleton. Megamind has fulfilled the supervillain's dream, to the shock of everyone (including Megamind himself): he has vanquished the superhero, and Metro City is now his to take over!<br/><br/>Megamind revels in his victory, and sets about vandalizing and pillaging Metro City. However,as time passes he becomes depressed and empty. He realizes that a supervillain has no point without a superhero to fight: without Metro Man, his life has lost all fun, challenge and purpose. He pays a visit to the Metro Man museum to express his condolences, and there meets Roxanne, who has come for the same reason. He disguises himself as the museum curator Bernard, and the two establish a friendship with each other. Roxanne is optimistic that a hero will soon rise to oppose Megamind's villainy, and this gives Megamind an idea: if heroes were 'not born but created', he will create a hero to fight, and thus restore balance to Metro City and purpose to his life!<br/><br/>Megamind uses Metro Man's DNA to forge a special serum that provides superpowers. However at the moment of near completion, Roxanne sneaks into Megamind's lair to find out what his future evil plans are. In the resulting melee the serum is accidentally ingested by Roxanne's friend Hal Stewart, a smug and lazy cameraman who has an obsessive crush on Roxanne and who's been overlooked and ignored his whole life. Despite these qualities, Megamind feels Hal was chosen by destiny for heroics. Megamind, disguised as a Space Dad, trains Hal into Titan, Metro City's upcoming new hero. Titan appears to Roxanne and carries out superhuman feats to impress her, but she rejects him because she likes Bernard.<br/><br/>In the meantime, Megamind carries on a romance with Roxanne through his Bernard alias, which starts to give him hope about a normal life, beyond villainy. This unfortunately creates conflict with Minion, who believes that as villains they'll never find romance or acceptance. A quarrel ensues between the duo, which ends with Minion leaving because he thinks Megamind doesn't need him anymore. Later, at a romantic dinner, Roxanne discovers Megamind's disguise and rejects him.<br/><br/>Heartbroken and friendless, Megamind does what supervillains do: start a rampage across town and a battle with a superhero. But Titan does not show up, and eventually Megamind has to head over to Hal's apartment to pick him up. There he discovers Titan has had enough of rejection, and has decided to strike back and become a supervillain, offering a team up with Megamind. A shocked Megamind reveals his Space Dad and Bernard identities to Titan and successfully provokes a superhuman fight. But upon defeating Megamind, an enraged Titan tries to murder him; Megamind barely escapes, and Titan proclaims himself Metro City's new supervillain and starts tearing up the town.<br/><br/>Noting that a copper-based attack proved ineffective on Titan, Megamind convinces a reluctant Roxanne to head to Metro Man's lair to check for anything that could help stop Titan. They both check out the base, and discover to their shock that Metro Man is staying there, alive! He explains to them that he'd always wanted to be a musician, but just like Megamind he got typecast and trapped as a superhero, and eventually the role became too unbearable; he thus faked his weakness to copper and subsequent death, to forever rid himself of heroism. He refuses to return, and nominates Megamind as his successor and Roxanne backs him up, but Megamind refuses as he believes he is condemned to be a villain for life.<br/><br/>Megamind turns himself into the prison he was raised, while Roxanne heads into Metro City to try to reason with Titan. Titan, gone over the edge, instead captures Roxanne and makes a TV broadcast to call out Megamind, exhibiting her to make sure he comes. Roxanne begs Megamind to save her and Metro City from Titan, and Minion returns to stand by Megamind's side; this finally inspires him to escape from prison. A fierce battle follows across Metro City, where Megamind eventually defeats Titan by stripping him of his powers, turning him back into Hal.<br/><br/>The film ends with Hal in Megamind's prison cell, and Megamind being accepted and hailed by Metro City as its new hero, with Roxanne as his girlfriend, felicitating his own museum and approval from a disguised Metro Man.</li>\n","</ul>\n","</section>\n","<div class=\"article\" id=\"see_also\">\n","<h2>See also</h2>\n","<p>\n","<span class=\"nobr\">\n","<a class=\"link\"

One child, a handsome boy endowed with superpowers, landed in a mansion and was admired by all; he became the superhero Metro Man. The other, a blue-skinned baby with super genius, ended up in a prison and was shunned by society; he became the supervillain Megamind, Metro Man's rival.<br/><br/>All is as usual in Metro City: the town felicitates Metro Man with the inauguration of his own museum, when Megamind gatecrashes the event and announces that he has (once again) escaped from prison with the help of his childhood friend/henchman Minion. Following routine, he has once again kidnapped Metro Man's girlfriend, reporter Roxanne Ritchi. Megamind lures Metro Man into a sealed observatory which will be blown up by a laser, but the laser takes too long to start up, so once more Megamind has failed and Metro Man is victorious... but Metro Man can't escape the observatory. He states that the observatory is lined with copper, which drains his powers. Unable to escape when the laser activates, Metro Man is incinerated into a skeleton. Megamind has fulfilled the supervillain's dream, to the shock of everyone (including Megamind himself): he has vanquished the superhero, and Metro City is now his to take over!<br/><br/>Megamind revels in his victory, and sets about vandalizing and pillaging Metro City. However,as time passes he becomes depressed and empty. He realizes that a supervillain has no point without a superhero to fight: without Metro Man, his life has lost all fun, challenge and purpose. He pays a visit to the Metro Man museum to express his condolences, and there meets Roxanne, who has come for the same reason. He disguises himself as the museum curator Bernard, and the two establish a friendship with each other. Roxanne is optimistic that a hero will soon rise to oppose Megamind's villainy, and this gives Megamind an idea: if heroes were 'not born but created', he will create a hero to fight, and thus restore balance to Metro City and purpose to his life!<br/><br/>Megamind uses Metro Man's DNA to forge a special serum that provides superpowers. However at the moment of near completion, Roxanne sneaks into Megamind's lair to find out what his future evil plans are. In the resulting melee the serum is accidentally ingested by Roxanne's friend Hal Stewart, a smug and lazy cameraman who has an obsessive crush on Roxanne and who's been overlooked and ignored his whole life. Despite these qualities, Megamind feels Hal was chosen by destiny for heroics. Megamind, disguised as a Space Dad, trains Hal into Titan, Metro City's upcoming new hero. Titan appears to Roxanne and carries out superhuman feats to impress her, but she rejects him because she likes Bernard.<br/><br/>In the meantime, Megamind carries on a romance with Roxanne through his Bernard alias, which starts to give him hope about a normal life, beyond villainy. This unfortunately creates conflict with Minion, who believes that as villains they'll never find romance or acceptance. A quarrel ensues between the duo, which ends with Minion leaving because he thinks Megamind doesn't need him anymore. Later, at a romantic dinner, Roxanne discovers Megamind's disguise and rejects him.<br/><br/>Heartbroken and friendless, Megamind does what supervillains do: start a rampage across town and a battle with a superhero. But Titan does not show up, and eventually Megamind has to head over to Hal's apartment to pick him up. There he discovers Titan has had enough of rejection, and has decided to strike back and become a supervillain, offering a team up with Megamind. A shocked Megamind reveals his Space Dad and Bernard identities to Titan and successfully provokes a superhuman fight. But upon defeating Megamind, an enraged Titan tries to murder him; Megamind barely escapes, and Titan proclaims himself Metro City's new supervillain and starts tearing up the town.<br/><br/>Noting that a copper-based attack proved ineffective on Titan, Megamind convinces a reluctant Roxanne to head to Metro Man's lair to check for anything that could help stop Titan. They both check out the base, and discover to their shock that Metro Man is staying there, alive! He explains to them that he'd always wanted to be a musician, but just like Megamind he got typecast and trapped as a superhero, and eventually the role became too unbearable; he thus faked his weakness to copper and subsequent death, to forever rid himself of heroism. He refuses to return, and nominates Megamind as his successor and Roxanne backs him up, but Megamind refuses as he believes he is condemned to be a villain for life.<br/><br/>Megamind turns himself into the prison he was raised, while Roxanne heads into Metro City to try to reason with Titan. Titan, gone over the edge, instead captures Roxanne and makes a TV broadcast to call out Megamind, exhibiting her to make sure he comes. Roxanne begs Megamind to save her and Metro City from Titan, and Minion returns to stand by Megamind's side; this finally inspires him to escape from prison. A fierce battle follows across Metro City, where Megamind eventually defeats Titan by stripping him of his powers, turning him back into Hal.<br/><br/>The film ends with Hal in Megamind's prison cell, and Megamind being accepted and hailed by Metro City as its new hero, with Roxanne as his girlfriend, felicitating his own museum and approval from a disguised Metro Man.</li>\n","</ul>\n","</section>\n","<div class=\"article\" id=\"see_also\">\n","<h2>See also</h2>\n","<p>\n","<span class=\"nobr\">\n","<a class=\"link\"

They are raised in different environments of Metro City but study in the same school for gifted children. While one becomes popular but selfish, the other is absolutely outcast by the other students. They become enemies and when they grow up, the population knows them as the superhero Metro Man and the villain Megamind. In their fights, Megamind always loses and ends up in prison; however, Megamind develops a ray that kills Metro Man, reducing him to a skeleton. After a short period, Megamind feels bored without the battles against Metro Man. Meanwhile he dates field reporter Roxanne Ritchie, who works with cameraman Hal Stewart, using the identity of curator Bernard and sooner they fall in love with each other. When Megamind decides to create another superhero to become his opponent, he accidentally transforms Hal Stewart into the super-powered Tighten, expecting that he would use his powers for good. However, Tighten becomes greedy and evil and destroys Metro City. Now Megamind is the only hope to save the world from the mean Tighten.\n"],"name":"stdout"}]}]}
